SkeuoCord gives Discord a skeuomorphic overhaul. Almost every part of its interface, from channels to the Server Boost page, is themed for a complete look. Both dark and light themes *(including the Dark Sidebar option for the light theme)* are supported. 
- *User avatar radiuses-borders, app background image, text shadows and UI element colors can be customized. Look for the related variables in the theme import file.*

- *SkeuoCord requires English (US/UK) to be the selected language for button icon theming, due to the way they're specified in Discord.* 
*If your client is set to another language, the color of the regular icons will be changed and dropshadow filters will be applied to them instead.*
- *If you don't want to use SkeuoCord's brand color replacement, use SkeuoCord_NoBrandReplace.theme.css from SkeuoCord's GitHub repo.*
